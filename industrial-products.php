                <h4>Mezzanine Floor</h4>
                
                <p>A mezzanine floor is an excellent way of gaining additional space without building. Mezzanine floors offer a good space-saving option where there are severe space constraints. Many of our customers place orders with us for the design, fabrication and installation of mezzanine floors as per their requirements. These are pre-fabricated and pre-painted at our factory. Standard, ready made mezzanine floors are also available. Easy to assemble at the client's site, our mezzanine floors are very popular among clients representing a wide spectrum of industries. Complete construction of these mezzanine floors is done with fasteners without any use of welding. The mezzanine floors are manufactured using sheet metal, and can take load from 500 kg Uniformly Distributed Load (UDL) per sq. mtr. up to 2500 kg UDL per sq. mtr.</p>
 
				<p>From our experience, we have found that a column of the floor up to 15 feet wide has been adequate for all the cases that we have come across so far. This specification is adequate to ensure unobstructed movement underneath the mezzanine floor. Our designs fall within these limits.</p>
